Do you need some extra pocket money? Your car needs a check-up. She need have no fear in Harlem. He needs to work late on Fridays. All you need learn is phonetics. He doesn't need to go home before midnight. He needn't go home. Does she need to diet throughout the year? She needn't have dieted so strictly.
I am able to do this.
I am going to call you because I've heard that you are going to Ibiza. We used to hang out together. I'm not used to loud music. He got beaten up. You need just ask. Or do I need a cup of tea?
She doesn't need to go yet. She needn't go. Need I come and see you every day? You needn't trust me. Needn't you go right now? I need you. Do I need her too? Or do I need to call her?
Do we always have to set the alarm before we leave the house? or does he do that? Why did you say that?
I am really just chilling. He must have been talking to me. You have got to be kidding me. You ought to have arrived by 5 p.m. I cannot accept your behaviour. They were to join up with the company. I won't go. I wasn't to leave the hall. Shall he do it before the end of the week? I'll do it. I'd rather you went alone.
